I'm really excited about Alfred coming out with Version 2 of their award-winning app. I decided to write a small Extension that allows Mac users to easily switch the contexts of their Function Keys. Starcraft gamers like myself often have to dig deep into System Preferences to toggle Function Keys, only to have to go back to toggle them back to their normal Volume Up/Down states. Alfred to the rescue! By simply typing the keyword fkeys you will be able to toggle the context of your Function Keys. You will be able to toggle between normal Function Keys, or hardware/media controlled Function Keys. Remember that you need the Alred Powerpack to be able to install this and many more incredibly productive Extensions.All you need to do is simply click here to download the Alfred Extension and double-click to import the script in Alfred. Now, let's play some Starcraft.
